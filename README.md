# Virtual Reality Bicycle Simulator (Developing)

This project is a Virtual Reality application that simulates riding a bicycle using real-world sensors and a 3D environment built in Unity for the Meta Quest 3.

## How it Works

- Handlebar Control:
A potentiometer is attached to the real bicycle’s handlebar axis using a custom 3D-printed mount. It captures steering movements and sends them to the virtual bicycle.

- Speed Tracking:
A bicycle speedometer sensor with a magnet detects when the wheel completes one rotation. From this, the system calculates the current speed.

- Data Processing:
Both steering and speed data are collected by a server, formatted, and transmitted to the Meta Quest 3 via Sockets.

- Virtual Simulation:
Inside the VR headset, a Unity application simulates the 3D bicycle, updating its rotation and movement based on real sensor inputs.

## Features

### Procedural City Generation: 

- An infinite 3D city is generated at runtime, allowing players to ride endlessly through the environment.

### Gameplay Mechanics:

- Collect coins scattered throughout the city.

- Pick up speed multiplier items to temporarily boost base speed.

### Goal

The project combines hardware integration, real-time data streaming, and VR development to create a fun and immersive experience of riding a bicycle inside a virtual world.
